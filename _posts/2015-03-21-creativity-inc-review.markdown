Creativity Inc is Ed Calmutt's story about his career, the rise of Pixar and
people who played part in it, and most of all, a collection of management advice
from the president of one the most creative and innovative companies in movie
industry. I read the book as part of a resolution to finish reading more books
instead of internet blogs or only starting reading. To make it more forceful I
decided to read books from Facebook's [A Year of books club][bookclub]. That was
a good decision, normally I wouldn't touch a book about management, but after
reading Creativity Inc I'm glad I didn't listen to my apprehensive self.

The book consists of 4 parts. Firstly Calmutt tells us where he came from. His
childhood fascination with Disney's works and ambitions in computer graphics
fields gave him necessary technical experience and the dream of creating
fully-featured films with computer animation. He shows how, though he started as
ambitious and successful grad student, his skills put him into managerial
positions and how he made friends and contacts with people with whom he would
later start Pixar.

In the second and third part we are shown main processes and tenets that
Calmutt thinks foster creativity and make Pixar's movies have such quality.
First of all he considers the story to be the most important element of the
film. Although Pixar pushes technical boundaries with each movie, it is the
story that drives a movie forward not the other way around. While following that
tenet serves as a linchpin for Pixar's train, the main engine is its culture. To
inhibit creativity one needs to promote and protect candor, risk-taking, sense
of comradery. While explaining these principles we are shown examples of how
dangerous situations and factors have been resolved at Pixar by following them.
What I particularly liked in those chapters is that Calmutt avoids preaching. He
instead shows great amounts of reflection and self-doubt when explaining them. A
good manager should always be aware that large amount of his job is not under
his control or even is invisible to him. He should not get conceited with his
success, but instead try to recognize how much of it was luck and what can he do
to reproduce it.

The last part tells us about the merge of Disney and Pixar and how it allowed
Calmutt to implement his ideas in Disney's environment. This experiment resulted
in Disney's rebirth. Such movies as Frozen, Wreck-it-Ralph are the evidence of
his success and give credence to the superiority of his methods in managing a
creative company.

The book also has a co-author, a professional writer, Amy Wallace, her work
made the book read really well. It is very fluid and well placed. I was never
bored while reading it.

All in all I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the inner
workings of Pixar and the rationale behind their processes from the perspective
from someone who creates them. The book is very enjoyable as well as
educational.
