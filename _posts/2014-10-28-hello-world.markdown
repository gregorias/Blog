Welcome to my blog. This site is meant to motivate me to work more dilligently
on my projects and finish them thoroughly and as a reminder of interesting or
at least helpful stuff that I have done. Hopefully there will be some content
that might be of interested to someone else as well.

The idea of making my own blog has been in my head for quite some time, but only
recently all factors have aligned so neatly that I couldn't resist making
something up. Firstly Github started offering a student package, a collection of
webapp services for free. So I signed up at [namecheap][namecheap] and got
myself gregorias.me domain. After coming back from my internship at NVIDIA I
bought myself new 14" notebook. My old 10" netbook became obsolete as far as
note taking goes. Therefore I could use it as my home server since it's quiet,
unlike my more powerful machines. Lastly I found out about static site
generators, like [Jekyll][jekyll], which make blogging as easy as possible.

So here we go, let's see what this blog will bring.
