I am a student of Double Degree Program in Computer Science and Mathematics at
University of Warsaw. I am currently pursuing master's degree in CS and
bachelor's in mathematics. Needless to say, both are my passions. When I am not
working (or playing) in my field I like to run, bike, eat sushi with friends or
read a good book.
